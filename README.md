# 12-Numbers-Dates-Timers-Bankist

This is chapter 12 of [Jonas Schmedtmann's](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) complete-javascript-course. I did not edit the HTML or CSS files. I only wrote the Javascript file. I watched the requirements and wrote the code before I see the video. After having the project working as supposed to, I renamed some functions to match the names on Jonas' code.

The code is here for anyone to benefit from seeing another version of the same project. Feel free to copy an dmodify as you like.

# Installation

Just copy the code from the script.js file
